Instructions to create your own TimWien Tourist Information System


1.) Preparations:

Download the Oracle VM Virtual Box.
You need it to create and start the Virtual machine on your computer.

Download OS Geo Live.

Download the project code form github. Leave the structure of the folders untouched.

Download the sample data.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________


2.) Work environment:

Create the Virtual machine by clicking “new” and generating a new image in  “Orcale VM Virtual Box”. 
Choose “use existing disk” and generate a path to OS Geo Live folder. 

Create a shared folder on your computer and connetc it to the virtual machine. 
First create a folder on your computer. 
Open the VM Icon and choose “settings” – “shared folders” – “add shared folder” and choose the path 
to the folder you created. Make sure you check “bind/incorporate” and “generate permanent”.
You need it to move all the relevant data and code into the virtual machine. 

Unpack the code and the sample data and move it to the shared folder on your computer. 
Please don’t change the structure of the code folders. Copy the folders from the shared folders 
and store it to: /var/www/html

3.) Database & Geoserver:

Database:

Set up the database (post gis database). Here is an example how to handle it with pgAdminII
To include the plugins you need to open the PSQL-Console and type in:
1) sudo apt-add-repository ppa:sharpie/postgis-nightly
2) sudo apt-get update
3) sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1-postgis

Now you can create a new Database

You also need to create an extension in postgis (in pgadmin3-> look for you database 
-> tab Extension (right click -> new extension)
If you use your own database, you must change the name of the database, the user and the password in the file connection.php.

Settings to work with GUI (so you don’t need to use the console anymore) to import shapefiles

Disable write protection (dataset is naturally protected)
LXTerminal (taskbar on the bottom) --> sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/pgadmin3/plugins.d/plugins.ini   
(Enter -> data can be edited and saved)

add plugins.ini (copy/paste):

; pgShapeLoader (Linux):
;
Title=PostGIS Shapefile and DBF loader
Command=$$PGBINDIR/shp2pgsql-gui -U $$USERNAME -d $$DATABASE -p $$PORT -h $$HOSTNAME
Description=Open a PostGIS ESRI Shapefile or Plain dbf loader console to the current database.
KeyFile=$$PGBINDIR/shp2pgsql-gui
Platform=unix
ServerType=postgresql
Database=Yes
SetPassword=No



Geoserver:
Start Geoserver, load and store your data, that should be published via the WMS TimWien Tourist 
Information System. Add a new workspace (give a name and type in the path to your folder filled with data). 
Go to “layers” and add a new ressource, choose where you want to add the layer from, decide for a layer and publish it. 
Then you have to set settings. As coordinate reference systems you need “EPSG:4326”, 
compute bounding boxes from data and choose a default style for publishing.

4.) Look at your WMS & work with it:

To look on your WMS you need to start the geoserver. 
Then search the index html page in the code folders (/var/www/html) and start it by double clicking.

5.) If the permission is denied in localhost, you have to change the rights:

- Open console in Virtual Box
- navigate to the folder: cd /XXX/<folder>
- change the reading rights for a folder or file: chmod a+r <folder- or filename>
- overview of the rights: ls -la  (third last sign in the left column should be now an r)
